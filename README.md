## Step 1: Clone the Repository
# Clone your project repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

## Step 2: Initialize npm (if not already initialized)
npm init -y
```
This command creates a `package.json` file, which helps manage dependencies.

## Step 3: Install Cypress
npm install cypress --save-dev
This installs Cypress as a development dependency.

npm install --save-dev cypress-mochawesome-reporter

## Check the import path: Ensure that the import path in your cypress/support/index.js file is correct. It should look like this:
```
import 'cypress-mochawesome-reporter/register';


npm audit fix

## Step 4: Open Cypress for the First Time
```sh
npx cypress open
```
This will generate a default Cypress folder structure:
```
/project-folder
 â”œâ”€â”€ cypress/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fixtures/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ integration/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ plugins/
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ support/
 â”œâ”€â”€ cypress.json
 â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
 â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/
```

## Step 5: Add Cypress Scripts to `package.json`
Modify the `scripts` section in `package.json` to include Cypress commands:
```json
"scripts": {
  "cypress:open": "cypress open",
  "cypress:run": "cypress run"
}
```
Now you can run Cypress with:
```sh
npm run cypress:open   # Opens Cypress GUI
npm run cypress:run    # Runs tests in headless mode
```

## Step 6: Writing Your First Test
Create a new test file in `cypress/integration/`:
```sh
touch cypress/integration/sample_test.spec.js
```
Add the following test inside `sample_test.spec.js`:
```js
describe('My First Test', () => {
  it('Visits the Cypress homepage', () => {
    cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io')
    cy.contains('features').click()
    cy.url().should('include', '/features')
  })
})
```
Run the test:
```sh
npm run cypress:run
```

## Step 7: Setting Up Cypress in GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Create a `.github/workflows/cypress.yml` file and add:
```yaml
name: Cypress Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Cypress tests
        run: npm run cypress:run
```
Commit and push changes:
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Setup Cypress"
git push origin main
```

## Step 8: Ignoring Unnecessary Files
To prevent tracking unnecessary files, add the following to `.gitignore`:
```
node_modules/
cypress/videos/
cypress/screenshots/
```

## Conclusion
You have successfully set up Cypress in your Git repository! ðŸŽ‰
Now, you can start writing and running E2E tests to ensure the quality of your application.
